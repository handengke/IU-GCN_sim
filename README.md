# This is a *Simple Simulator* of IGCN:Island Locator

## Some questions about the raw version of this algorithm:
- *Q1*: When processing a task {hub0,a0} in which a0 is one of hub0's negihbors, hub0 is also in the adjacent list of a0, and it'll be recognized as a hub, according to the raw algorithm, it'll be added to Hlocal, which is inappropriate here.
  In fact, we should add a `if(a0.neighbor is a hub and not in Hlocal)` logic here to avoid redundant hub0 in Hlocal.
- *Q2*: Consider n0 is one of a0's nebighbors, if no is not in Vlocal but in Vglobal, according to the raw algorithm, first it deletes Vlocal from Vglobal, and then it drops the BFS task but add the {Hlocal, Vlocal} to Lislands.
  In fact, in a parallel hardware platform, this condition indicates that this region which includes n0 **is processing or have been processed** by another engine, and it should not touch it again. However, the nodes that have already visited by this engine and recorded in Vlocal and Vglobal are not been visited by other engines for certain, so why should we remove Vlocal from Vglobal? I think the only thing we should do is to add {Hlocal, Vlocal} to Lislands without remove options here. Or, from another perspective, if we remove Vlocal from Vglobal, then we should not add {Hlocal, Vlocal} to Lislands because of the flowing two main reasons:
  - We remove Vlocal from Vglobal to indicate that this region will be visited by another PE.
  - If we do them both, then we'll find that there exists some nodes which are in Lislands but not in Vglobal, it's obviously not right.
We decided to add but not remove here. 
- *Q3*: The raw algorithm use hub's neighbor as the start point of BFS, however, it only checks if the neighbor's neighbor is in Vglobal, but there is no operation performed here to check if the start point itself has been visited, obviously, if yes, then this task will be thoroughly. So we add the flowing codes:
    ```c++
    if(find(Vglobal.begin(),Vglobal.end(),cur_task.second)!=Vglobal.end()) continue;
    ```
    If we find the start point in Vglobal, that means it has been identified as an island_node, we drop this task directly and wait for the next one.
## Some optimizations based on the raw algorithm:
- *OP1*: We noticed that it'll generate lots of small islands in which there only exists one or two island_nodes except the hubs. This may lead to that the enhancement of the spatial locality will be limited, in the meanwhile, it'll increasing complexity of island management. So we add an `push_and_merge()` func to add islands into Lislands and check if it needs to be merged with other islands according to the minimum number of an island,i.e.Cmin.
- *OP2*ï¼š


We found that after the islands build process has finished, the total number of hubs plus island_nodes is smaller than the origin node numbers. Through data analysis, we found that there exists another type of nodes, it has only one neighbor and so as its neighbor. I think it's unavoidably so I do nothing about this.
